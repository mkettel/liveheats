## Getting Started

```bash 
npm install
```

Then: 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Should open up localhost to see the project locally. 

### Thoughts
Teachers can create a race
- Race must have at least 2 students, can select students, can select lanes for students

Teachers can view the created race
- Here the teachers can say what place the students got

Homepage
- can select to create or view created races

/races/new
- can create the new race

/races
- can see all of the races

/races/[id]
- can see the race that was selected and the students in it to set the place they got
